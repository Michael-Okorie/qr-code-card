# qr-code-card - QR Code Component Solution

This is my solution to the [QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). It's a clean and minimal UI component challenge that helped me sharpen my responsive layout and styling skills.  

Frontend Mentor challenges are a great way to improve coding skills by building real-world projects — and this one, though simple, was all about mastering precision and visual balance. 👨‍💻✨

## 🧠 My process

### 🛠️ Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox** for layout
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- Clean and minimalist design practices

---

### 💡 What I learned

Even a small component like a QR card has a lot to teach. This challenge helped me refine the following:

- How to **center elements** perfectly both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox:
  
```css
body{
    background-color: var(--Slate300);
    font-size: 15px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 30px auto;
    position: relative;
    min-height: 100vh;
}

```

Improved understanding of using rem/em units for responsive padding and spacing

Creating a visually balanced card component

### 💡 What I learned

This project may look simple, but it taught me some powerful fundamentals:

- Improved understanding of using **`rem` / `em` units** for scalable, responsive spacing  
- Practiced crafting a **visually balanced card component** with proper use of whitespace and typography  
- Gained confidence in applying **mobile-first design principles** effectively

---

### 🔄 Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Integrate subtle **CSS animations** for smoother interactions (like hover states)  
- Explore **Sass** and **CSS Modules** to better organize and scale styles  
- Focus more on **accessibility**, especially keyboard navigation and visible focus indicators
